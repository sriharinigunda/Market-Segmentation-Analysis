This case study focuses on market segmentation analysis using a new dataset. The dataset was originally collected to evaluate different survey formats' effectiveness in studying brand image. The study aims to determine if there are distinct customer segments with different perceptions of the McDonald's brand. Identifying systematic variations in brand perceptions among segments helps in targeting specific segments and tailoring messages accordingly. McDonald's can focus on segments with positive perceptions to enhance those beliefs or address segments with negative perceptions by understanding the key drivers and making necessary changes.
